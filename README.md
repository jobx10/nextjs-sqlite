This is a [Next.js]  [sqlite3] [better-sqlite3] project 

## Getting Started










First, run the development server:

npx create-next-app@latest my-nextjs-app
cd my-nextjs-app
npm install sqlite3 better-sqlite3



Create a SQLite Database

Create a file called database.js in the lib directory to manage SQLite operations. You might also need to create the directory if it doesn't exist.


Implement Database Logic

In lib/database.js, set up a class to handle SQLite operations:
pages/api/users.js








```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```









Test Your Application

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000] to see the user list, and go to [http://localhost:3000/create-user] to add new users.
